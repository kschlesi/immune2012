=========

updated 8/09/2013:
post-PRL submission, unnecessary files are cleared,
nodel is abandoned, and PLdynamics will be merged 
to 1Dmutation... in preparation for simplification

updated 5/31/2012:
new branch PLdynamics has been created to allow runs
with simplified diffeqs and only two types of cells;
new paramfiles use 'bfilename'

updated 3/26/2013:
at this point, parameter files have been created
for all runs with _dy set at oldc/10. this includes
all edge, carrycap, and several quant.

henceforth all runs will be saved with a datafile
containing values of all parameters and total days run.
_main_cont and _plot set parameters with these files.

important developments will be committed, but the scheme
of saving every run as a commit will now be abandoned.

branches deleted: Hsat and carrycap; all work currently
merged into 1Dmutation.

updated 1/17/2013:
henceforth all datafiles will be saved in
/MATLAB/immune2012_data directory;
scripts used to produce each datafile will be committed
with commit message 'filename.txt, relevant parameters'

updated 1/16/2013:
at this point, immune2012 directory exists
on both desktop and laptop computers;
branches abandoned: fixed_ts, more_stochastic!;
branches deleted: odeforloop;
branches still developing: stoch_try, Hsat, 2Dcutoff;
lower base branches: 1Dmutation, master, 2Dmutation;

1Dmutation now main 1Dmaster branch; all files cleared.
